The Physical 100 Encyclopedia

## Overview

The Physical 100 Encyclopedia is your one-stop-shop for everything about the South Korean reality competition series on Netflix â€” Physical 100.

### Problem

The only way to find any information about Physical 100 contestants are to scroll through long web articles, and information is often unavailable, sparse, or requires reading long paragraphs. The Physical 100 Encyclopedia is meant to package data from the various articles about the show in an easy-to-digest, user-friendly web app. Users will be able to reference challenges and contestants from all seasons through this web app. Users will also be able to edit information on the app, much like other online encyclopedias, encouraging a culture of open source knowledge.
