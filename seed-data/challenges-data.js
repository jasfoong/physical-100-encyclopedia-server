The contestant with possession of the ball at the 3-minute mark proceeded to the next Quest, while the other contestant was eliminated. Before the quest, contestants were ranked based on their Quest 0 timing, and contestants that were ranked higher had the benefit to choose their opponent and the type of Battle Arena they want to compete in: Battle Arena A included many obstacles, emphasizing contestant agility and speed. Battle Arena B was simpler, with a large flat area of sand with a pool of water in the middle, emphasizing contestant strength and grappling ability. If neither contestant had possession after three minutes, the competition was restarted with one minute on the clock. Fifty contestants were eliminated in the process."

The ten contestants with the most votes were declared team leaders and were ranked based on the numbers of votes they received. Contestants lined up for the team leader they wanted to join. In order of their number of votes, each team leader picked four members to form a team of five. Contestants who were not chosen had to pick another team. For Quest 2, each team of five had to work together to build a bridge, and then carry bags of sand across the bridge. Teams were not allowed to pass bags of sand to another team member; they had to carry the bags of sand individually to the other end. After twelve minutes, the team with the least amount of sand accumulated was eliminated."

The teams spent some time debating how they would join, with the last two excluded teams being joined by default. The combined teams of ten had to each work together to dig up oak barrels from the sand and load them onto a 1.5-tonne ship. The additional weight of the oak barrels was 0.5-tonne, meaning the combined load weighed 2.0 tonnes. The teams then had to drag/push the ship off a wooden platform onto logs in the sand, across the sand-filled arena on the logs, then up a wooden ramp until they could pull a mooring rope over an iron stake. The two teams with the fastest time progressed to the next Quest, while the team with the slowest time was eliminated. Team 1 and Team 2 won with times of 13:34 and 19:55 respectively. Team 3 lost with a time of 22:15 and was eliminated."
