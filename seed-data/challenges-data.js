By the end of the round, the 50 with the least amount of distance covered were eliminated. The following round was shorter at seven minutes with only 10 of the 50 contestants making it to the final round. For the final round, the remaining 10 ran for five minutes. The final results will determine the winner who gets an advantage in the first official quest."

The captains then formed their teams of five players based on needed strength, agility, and speed. Ten teams went up against each other in a race through a complex maze to add weighted bags to three different scales throughout the course. The weighted bags vary from 6-20kg. The team with the most secured weighted scales wins. The scales remained fixed until the five-minute mark when they tipped towards the team that had accumulated the most weight. There is one 15-minute round in this quest."

The previously eliminated teams gathered in a pit surrounded by 10 poles. With the timer set to three minutes, the contestants must try and secure one of the poles by hugging it. If more than one person is at a pole, the person hugging the symbol is declared the winner. The quest had four rounds in total, with the number of poles and remaining contestants decreasing with each round. The winner of Quest 2.5 allowed to pick four contestants from the eliminated pool to return and become a new team for the next quest. This was the quest in which the 'Avengers' team was born."

At the end of Quest 3, the team with the least amount of points gets eliminated. Round 1 is a two-person minecraft haul. The first person secures as much weight as possible at the end of a track before pushing the minecraft back to the starting point and unloading. The second person will go back and add more weight to total two tons. The team to finish first wins. Round 2 is the exact same, except it involves only one team member. Round 3 is a two-person mid-air transit. A weighted bag suspended on monkey bars must be pushed to the endpoint. Once the contestant reaches the end, they must hurry back to their starting point through the same monkey bars. Round 4 is the same, with only one team member."
