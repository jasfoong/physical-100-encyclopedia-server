Ten teams went up against each other in a race through a complex maze to add weighted bags to three different scales throughout the course. The weighted bags vary from 6-20kg. The team with the most secured weighted scales wins. The scales remained fixed until the five-minute mark when they tipped towards the team that had accumulated the most weight.
